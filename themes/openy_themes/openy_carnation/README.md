# Maintaining the theme.

##1. Install Yarn

###macOS

####Homebrew

You can install Yarn through the Homebrew package manager. 
This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

`brew install yarn`

If you use nvm or similar, you should exclude installing Node.js 
so that nvmâ€™s version of Node.js is used.

`brew install yarn --without-node`

####MacPorts

You can install Yarn through MacPorts. 
This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

`sudo port install yarn`

###Debian / Ubuntu

###Windows
https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

##2. Go to the theme's folder

`yarn install`

##3. Compile all assets

`yarn run build`

##4. Start watching all assets (for development)

`yarn run watch`
